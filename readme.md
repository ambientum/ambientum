# Ambientum

Keeping it uniform between development, staging and production environments is often something not easy.
On the last years, our buddy Docker has become more and more mature and now it's becoming the standard.

We all love Laravel and Vue.JS, but why develop a Rock Star code with a Kick-Ass framework
without an awesome environment?

No more "it worked on my machine"!

## What is does?
Ambientum can help you doing some amazing things, the 3 main scenarios are listed above:

- **Run Laravel and/or Vue.JS in Development.**
- **Run Laravel and/or Vue.JS in Production (Continuous Integration included).**
- **Replace local dependencies with Docker commands.**

## What do I need to know before getting started?

Before staging with Ambientum, a few pieces of knowledge must be in place:

#### For replacing local commands:
- The basics of Docker and Containers.
- Being comfortable around the command line.

#### For running a development Laravel or Vue.JS environment:
- Know how to operate `docker-compose`.


## Notice
Docker compose shipped with Docker is usually very old.
Please have the latest version installed from Github at https://github.com/docker/compose/releases.

## Images
If you are already comfortable with the tools and have played around Ambientum, here are the set of images available for usage,
so you can start building your environment with the tools that you may want.

> PHP 7.2 is available but yet without xDebug support, considering this, it will not receive the latest tag until xDebug stable is compatible with PHP 7.2

|Repository                 | Images/Tags                   | Description                                        |
|---------------------------|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| ambientum/**php**         | `7.2`, `latest`               | PHP v7.2 for command line and queues               |
|                           | `7.2-nginx`, `latest-nginx`   | PHP v7.2 with Nginx webserver                      |
|                           | `7.1`                         | PHP v7.1 for command line and queues               |

| ambientum/**node**        | `9`, `latest`, `current`      | Node.js v9.x                                       |
|                           | `8`, `lts`                    | Node.js v8.x                                       |

## Quick usage guide

### Replacing local commands:
One of the features of ambientum is allowing you to replace commands (normally painful to install) with their docker
based version.

There are a set of aliases that helps you with that task, and before proceeding you will need to install and
activate those aliases:

#### For Bash and ZSH Users:
```
curl -L https://github.com/codecasts/ambientum/raw/master/commands.bash -o ~/.ambientum_rc
source ~/.ambientum_rc
```

#### For Fish users:
```
curl -L https://github.com/codecasts/ambientum/raw/master/commands.fish -o ~/.ambientum_rc
source ~/.ambientum_rc
```

#### For Windows users (via Git Bash):

```
curl https://github.com/codecasts/ambientum/raw/master/commands.git-bash -o ~/.ambientum_rc
source ~/.ambientum_rc
```

#### For Windows users (via PowerShell):

```
curl -URI https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codecasts/ambientum/master/commands.ps1 -OutFile ambientum_rc.ps1
ambientum_rc.ps1
```

Once you have those commands activated, following the instructions above, you can start using them right away.

#### Notice: First execution may take some time since it will download the images

Everything Node.JS related can be executed by prefixing the `n` command or `nAlias` in Windows PoweShell. For example, let's say we need to install Gulp
```
n npm install -g gulp
n gulp --version
```

Everything PHP related can be executed by prefixing the `p` command or `pAlias` in Windows PowerShell. For example, lets say we want to run composer:

```
p composer global require some/package-here
```

Or even run php against a single file:
```
p php test.php
```

Another example would be starting a new Laravel project:

```
p composer create laravel/laravel my-project-name-here
```

### I do have a project, and I want to run it using docker
Well, that's the whole point of the project, the commands there was designed for quick usage of stand alone commands, so we have a great alternative when we have a project already, we can define a docker-compose.yml file that will expose and run the services we need.

> **Understanding the docker-compose compose tool is appreciated in order to use the following configuration files.**

#### Laravel docker-compose.yml


```yml
####
# ATENTION:
# Replace all occurences of sandbox with your project's name
####

# v2 syntax
version: '2'

# Named volumes
volumes:
  # Postgres Data
  sandbox-postgres-data:
    driver: local

  # MySQL Data
  sandbox-mysql-data:
    driver: local

  # Redis Data
  sandbox-redis-data:
    driver: local

services:
  # Postgres (10.3)
  postgres:
    image: postgres:10.3
    container_name: sandbox-postgres
    volumes:
      - sandbox-postgres-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=sandbox
      - POSTGRES_DB=sandbox
      - POSTGRES_USER=sandbox

  # MySQL (5.7)
  mysql:
    image: mysql:5.7
    container_name: sandbox-mysql
    volumes:

    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
    environment:
      - MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sandbox
      - MYSQL_DATABASE=sandbox
      - MYSQL_USER=sandbox
      - MYSQL_PASSWORD=sandbox

  # Redis
  cache:
    image: redis:4.0
    container_name: sandbox-redis
    command: --appendonly yes
    volumes:
      - sandbox-redis-data:/data
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"

  # PHP (with Nginx)
  # you can change from nginx to apache, just change session 'image'
  app:
    image: ambientum/php:7.2-nginx
    container_name: sandbox-app
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/app
    ports:
      - "80:8080"
    links:
      - postgres
      - mysql
      - cache

  # Laravel Queues
  queue:
    image: ambientum/php:7.2
    container_name: sandbox-queue
    command: php artisan queue:listen
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/app
    links:
      - mysql
      - cache
```

### Vue.js docker-compose.yml
Developing with Vue.js? We got you covered! Here is the docker-compose file:

```yml
version: '2'

services:
  # Web server - For live reload and development
  # This environment can be used to run npm and node
  # commands as well
  dev:
    image: ambientum/node:9
    container_name: sandbox-vue-dev
    command: npm run dev
    volumes:
      - .:/var/www/app
    ports:
      - 8080:8080

  # Testing dist on a "real" webserver
  production-server:
    image: nginx:stable-alpine
    container_name: sandbox-preview-server
    volumes:
      - ./dist:/usr/share/nginx/html
    ports:
      - 9090:80
```
